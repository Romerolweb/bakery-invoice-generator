# Invoice Generator App

This is a simple Invoice Generator application built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI. It allows you to create invoices by managing customers and products, calculating totals including GST, and generating PDF receipts.

The project is designed with a focus on modern practices, including TypeScript for type safety, separation of concerns for better maintainability and testability, and a clear file structure.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
*   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript for improved code quality and developer experience.
*   **Shadcn UI:** A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
*   **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
*   **Lucide React:** Icon library for React.
*   **Date-fns:** A modern JavaScript date utility library.
*   **UUID:** For generating unique identifiers.
*   **Puppeteer:** (Used internally for PDF generation) A Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to promote separation of concerns and modularity:

*   `src/lib/actions/`: Server actions for handling data operations.
*   `src/lib/data-access/`: Modules for interacting with data storage (e.g., JSON files).
*   `src/lib/services/`: Business logic and external service integrations (like PDF generation).
*   `src/components/ui/`: Re-usable UI components (Shadcn UI).
*   `src/app/`: Next.js application routes.

## Running with Docker Compose

You can run this project locally using Docker Compose. This will build the Docker image and start the application container.

1.  **Ensure Docker is installed:** Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env.dev` file:**
    Based on the `docker-compose.yml` file, you might need to set environment variables. Create a `.env.dev` file in the root of the project. For example:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    PDF_GENERATOR=pdfkit # or puppeteer
    # Add other environment variables if needed
    ```
4.  **Build and run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker image (if it doesn't exist or if `Dockerfile` or context has changed) and start the service defined in `docker-compose.yml`. The `-d` flag can be added to run in detached mode.

5.  **Access the application:**
    Once the container is running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in your `.env.dev` or `docker-compose.yml`).

6.  **Stopping the application:**
    To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running, or run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    If you ran in detached mode, you'll need to use `docker-compose down`.

### Notes:
* The `docker-compose.yml` is configured for development, including live reloading of code changes.
* PDFs generated by the application will be stored in a Docker volume named `pdf_data`, which persists even if the container is stopped and removed. This volume is mapped to `/app/src/lib/data/receipt-pdfs` inside the container.
* The application inside the container runs as the `node` user.
