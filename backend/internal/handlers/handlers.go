package handlers

// This file serves as the main entry point for all handlers
// Individual handler implementations are in separate files:
// - customer_handler.go
// - product_handler.go
// - receipt_handler.go
// - email_handler.go
// - errors.go (common error handling utilities)

// All handler types and their constructors are defined in their respective files.
// This allows for better code organization and maintainability.
